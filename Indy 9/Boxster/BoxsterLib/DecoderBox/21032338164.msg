Is this some kind of joke? You think most people will still understand?
I'm still recieving this stupid reminder. But maybe I didn't make myself
clear last time.
If you're so sure you don't want to represent me. Take me of your
maillist!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


With regards,
Joost

  Most people are understanding if it didn't work once you caould send it a
million times and it wouldn't but unless people let us know how can we do
somethnig about it.
  No worries we will take you off you don't really sound like the candidate
we want to represent.

      Dear Candidate,

      As an I.T. professional you can appreciate in I.T. there are sometimes
technical problems. One is that there are many ways ISP's code an
attachment. For example Hotmail is different from Yahoo.

      After substantial improvements the process should be working now for
those of you that notified us.

      Therefore please can you send your CV as an attachment form the  email
address you registered with us by replying or to cvupdate@confidentialit.com

      If for whatever reason you do not receive notification then please let
us know by sending an email to candidatequestions@confidentialit.com

      Please not this address (cvupdate@confidentialit.com) is automated and
therefore not read by staff, so apart from sending your CV all communication
should be sent to the address candidatequestions@confidentialit.com or as
other email addresses as per the website.

      Regards,

      Adam.
